# TutorUP with React

## Technologies
- React (frontend) & Redux (state management)
- Firebase Cloud Firestore (for cloud-hosted NOSQL database)

## Set Up
- Clone repo, cd into directory
- Run `npm install` or `yarn`
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Connect to Firebase

## Notes
- React-Redux-Firebase: allows us to integrate Firebase into Redux store without
having to create new reducers: Firebase and Firestore in state, also auth
